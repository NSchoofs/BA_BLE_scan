# BA_BLE_scan
ESP32 will scan for BLE devices and print signal strength of found ones. Heavily based on snippet by Neil Kolban. This code is only meant to be used for a single test.

If you need software like this look for it in Neil Kolbans repositories (https://github.com/nkolban?tab=repositories), as they are the original (and also a lot cleaner than my versions)
